    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20 is ideal)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>1 slice of cheese (cheddar, American, or your choice)</li>

        Instructions
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Form the Patty: Divide the ground beef into two equal portions and shape them into patties, about 3/4 inch thick. Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty (this helps them cook evenly). Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the Patty: Heat a skillet or grill over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for about 3-4 minutes on one side. Flip them and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Place the cheese slice on top of the patty during the last minute of cooking to melt.</li>
        <li>Toast the Bun (Optional): While the cheese melts, you can toast the hamburger bun in the same skillet for a minute or two until golden.</li>
        <li>Assemble: Place the cooked patty on the bottom half of the bun. Add your favorite toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard).</li>
        <li>Serve: Place the top half of the bun on the burger and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Feel free to customize with any toppings you like!</p>
